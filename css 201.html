    <div class="subTitle">MY CHLIDHOOD</div>
    <div>
        <p class="first-letter">I was born in Aba , Abia State in Nigeria. In a family of 6. I had a twin actually but he did not make it.My mom will always tease me that i was so small like pepsi bottle.<img src="childhood.jpg"> Normally as a last born i was mummy's  favourite but i was not spared if i misbehaved. I feared my Dad more than anything , His face was very scary , Just a glances at you ,You will immiediately do the right thing .   I was also sturbborn growing up .One obvious fact is that i  love soccer from birth. I loved fc barcelona from birth <br>My Dad had the habit of giving me  senior maths problems which i now really appreciate because i grew up to love maths and later studied mathematics in high institution</p><br>  My senior brother always took me when going to play football even though he was always yelled at whenever he comes back but he never stopped. I think thats where my love of football started. I took over from him when i grew up enough to play, i regularly come home late . My dad wll always scold me , trust me i will just go for a two or three days holiday and am back again . I had dream of playing Fc Barcelona but i had no support from my dad on that dream , he did not see been a footballer as a serious career.
        <p>I lost my mom when i was 13 years old , It felt like a dream until i saw her been laid in her grave ,i could not believe my eyes . I then knew the real meaning of death , You never know when or how , Life is sometimes not fair but only cowards complains , We keep pushing no matter what . My older sister became a mother to us , Innocent me was still wishing and hoping that someday my mom will one day walk into my mom and whisper "danny boy  i'm back" but it never happened . I had numerous dreams of her having lovely times until a relative gave me the  scariest advice in my life, Thst if i keep mourning her she will come and take me too , I can never forget her words.From then on, anytime i saw her in my dream , i run as far as i can , i was so stupid running from my own mom , but shoukd i be blame i was scared of death , With time i stopped seeing her in my dreams.</p>
